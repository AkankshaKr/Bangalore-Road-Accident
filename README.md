# Bangalore-Road-Accident
I created a comprehensive website for visualizing and analyzing road accident data in Bangalore for the year 2018, which includes various types of accidental alarm systems. The project began by collecting data from Kaggle, specifically focusing on road accident statistics for that year. To make this data accessible and meaningful, I harnessed the power of Pandas and NumPy, essential libraries in the Python programming language. These tools enabled me to process, clean, and manipulate the data, ensuring it was primed for analysis. For the front-end of the website, I chose Streamlit, a versatile web application framework in Python. This user-friendly interface allowed for seamless navigation and interaction with the data. The centerpiece of the website was a table displaying the complete dataset. This table was thoughtfully designed, featuring pagination that allowed users to view a limited number of rows at a time for efficient exploration. The interactivity didn't stop there; each column in the table had the functionality to sort and filter, transforming it into a dynamic tool for data exploration. To enhance the user experience further, I integrated a month number toggle that enabled users to select a specific month and view accidents that occurred during that period on a map. The map itself was sourced from Mapbox, a popular open-source mapping platform, with OpenStreetMap as the underlying view. To provide users with more in-depth insights, I incorporated a dropdown menu that allowed them to select from various accident alarm types. This selection dynamically updated both the map and a bar graph, providing visual representations of the chosen accident alarm type's data. The bar graph was designed as a stacked bar graph to accommodate and showcase all the different alarm types that took place in a given month. This graphical representation made it easy to compare and contrast the occurrence of these alarms over time. Additionally, I included a line graph, displaying the number of accidents over each month. This feature was crucial for understanding the relative ratios between each accident alarm type and identifying trends in road accidents throughout the year. The types of accidental alarm systems considered in this project include:
● Forward Collision Warnings (FCW): Alerts drivers of an imminent rear-end collision with a car, truck, or motorcycle.
● Urban Forward Collision Warnings (UFCW): Provides an alert before a possible low-speed collision with the vehicle in front, assisting drivers in heavy traffic at low speeds, typically below 30 km/h.
● Headway Monitoring Warning (HMW): Helps drivers maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle ahead by providing visual and audible alerts if the distance becomes unsafe. Active above 30 km/h, it displays the time in seconds to the vehicle in front when it becomes 2.5 seconds or less.
● Lane Departure Warnings (LDW): Provides an alert when the vehicle unintentionally departs from the driving lane without using turn signals, usually active above 55 km/h. It's further classified into LDWL (lane departures toward the left lane) and LDWR (lane departures toward the right lane). Pedestrians and Cyclist Detection and Collision Warning (PCW): Notifies the driver of a pedestrian or cyclist in the danger zone and alerts drivers of an imminent collision, working well when the vehicle is below 50 km/h.
● Overspeeding: Detects and classifies visible speed limit signs and provides visual indications when the vehicle's speed exceeds the posted speed limit.
Results includes that URBAN FORWARD COLLISION WARNINGS has the maximum accident type
 And LANE DEPARTURE WARNINGS has least accident type
